# 🚆 UK Train Rides Analysis (DEPI Project)

## 📖 Project Overview
This is a collaborative project developed as part of the DEPI program. The objective is to analyze the **UK Train Rides dataset** using **Power BI** in order to generate insights that support decision-making in the transportation sector.  

The work includes:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.  
- Forecasting the number of rides and revenue for the upcoming month.  
- Analyzing demand across different ticket classes.  
- Building an interactive dashboard to visualize findings.  
- Preparing a final report and presentation summarizing the results.
